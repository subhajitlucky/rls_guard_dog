# RLS Guard Dog - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
A classroom management system with advanced Row-Level Security (RLS) using Supabase, Next.js, and MongoDB integration.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row-Level Security
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access
- **Analytics**: MongoDB for aggregated class averages
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) + Supabase (Backend) + MongoDB Atlas

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ…
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Install dependencies (Supabase, MongoDB drivers)
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Set up project structure

**Commit**: `feat: initialize Next.js project with Supabase and MongoDB dependencies`

### Phase 2: Database Design & RLS Implementation
- [ ] Design database schema (schools, profiles, classrooms, progress)
- [ ] Create Supabase tables with proper relationships
- [ ] Implement Row-Level Security policies
- [ ] Test RLS with different user roles

**Target Commit**: `feat: implement database schema with row-level security policies`

### Phase 3: Authentication System
- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth
- [ ] Create user registration/login flows
- [ ] Implement role-based authentication
- [ ] Set up Next.js middleware for route protection

**Target Commit**: `feat: implement authentication with role-based access control`

### Phase 4: Core Application Pages
- [ ] Create authentication pages (login, signup)
- [ ] Build protected teacher dashboard
- [ ] Implement progress editing functionality
- [ ] Add student view for their own progress

**Target Commit**: `feat: build core application pages with role-based views`

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Create Supabase Edge Function for analytics
- [ ] Integrate MongoDB for class averages storage
- [ ] Implement real-time progress updates
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling

**Target Commit**: `feat: implement edge function with MongoDB integration for analytics`

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Test RLS policies thoroughly
- [ ] Validate authentication flows
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add error boundaries and loading states

**Target Commit**: `test: comprehensive testing of RLS policies and authentication`

### Phase 7: Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Final testing in production

**Target Commit**: `deploy: production deployment with documentation`

## Key Technical Concepts Demonstrated

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Students**: Can only see their own progress records
- **Teachers**: Can see/edit progress for students in their classes
- **Head Teachers**: Can see/edit all records in their school

### Next.js Features
- App Router with file-based routing
- Server and Client Components
- Middleware for authentication
- API routes for backend logic

### Supabase Integration
- Real-time subscriptions
- Authentication with custom user metadata
- Edge Functions for serverless computing
- PostgreSQL with advanced security

### MongoDB Integration
- Hybrid database architecture
- Aggregated analytics storage
- Edge Function data pipeline

## Development Guidelines
1. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
2. **Test RLS policies** after each database change
3. **Follow TypeScript best practices**
4. **Use conventional commit format**: `type(scope): description`
5. **Document complex logic** with inline comments

## Security Considerations
- Environment variables properly configured
- RLS policies tested with different user roles
- Authentication middleware on protected routes
- Input validation on all forms
- Secure MongoDB connection in Edge Functions
