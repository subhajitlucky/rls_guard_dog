# 🛡️ RLS Guard Dog

**Secure Classroom Management with Row-Level Security**

A Next.js application demonstrating advanced PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) with Supabase, featuring role-based access control for educational institutions.

## 📋 Round 1 – Practical Assignment Submission

**✅ Requirements Met:**
- **Live Deployment URL**: [https://rls-guard-dog-delta.vercel.app/](https://rls-guard-dog-delta.vercel.app/)
- **Public Git Repository**: [https://github.com/subhajitlucky/rls_guard_dog](https://github.com/subhajitlucky/rls_guard_dog)
- **Complete Commit History**: Full development history available

**🎯 Assignment Goal Achieved:**
Create classroom and progress tables linked by school_id, with row-level security that lets students see only their own records, teachers see every record in their classes, and the head teacher see all records in the school. Build a protected /teacher page in Next.js for editing progress. Add an Edge Function that calculates class averages and saves them to MongoDB.

## 🎯 Core Requirements

> **Task**: Create classroom and progress tables linked by school_id, with row-level security that lets students see only their own records, teachers see every record in their classes, and the head teacher see all records in the school. Build a protected /teacher page in Next.js for editing progress. Add an Edge Function that calculates class averages and saves them to MongoDB.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Schools table
CREATE TABLE schools (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Profiles table (extends Supabase auth.users)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('student', 'teacher', 'head_teacher')),
  school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Classrooms table
CREATE TABLE classrooms (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  teacher_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Progress table
CREATE TABLE progress (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  student_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  classroom_id UUID REFERENCES classrooms(id),
  score INTEGER CHECK (score >= 0 AND score <= 100),
  notes TEXT,
  recorded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Row-Level Security Policies**

#### **Students**: See only their own progress
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Students can view own progress" ON progress
FOR SELECT USING (
  student_id = auth.uid() AND 
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'student')
);
```

#### **Teachers**: See students in their classes
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can view class progress" ON progress
FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM classrooms c
    JOIN profiles p ON p.id = auth.uid()
    WHERE c.id = classroom_id 
    AND c.teacher_id = auth.uid()
    AND p.role = 'teacher'
  )
);
```

#### **Head Teachers**: See all school records
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Head teachers can view school progress" ON progress
FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM classrooms c
    JOIN profiles p ON p.id = auth.uid()
    WHERE c.id = classroom_id 
    AND c.school_id = p.school_id
    AND p.role = 'head_teacher'
  )
);
```
